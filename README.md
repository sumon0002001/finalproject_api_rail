<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The objective of this project was to create a tracking App in which a user is presented with a list of things to be measured. For the Front End, I used React and Ruby on Rails for the Back-End API.

Live version of the project: [Live version]()

Project Link: [Final-capstone API](https://github.com/sumon0002001/finalproject_api_rail)


<!-- THE BACKEND API -->
## The Back End API

The back-end for this project consists of a REST API that manages the health database. This database is integrated by the next tables:

1. User Table: For storing username, and encrypted password and password confirmation

2. Health Table: For storing the name of the illness, and its description. It is depended on the user.

3. Tracking Table:  Include the daily information of the illness. This information includes:
* Temperature
* Mood
* Date
* Medicines
* Symptoms
